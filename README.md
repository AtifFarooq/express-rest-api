# express-rest-api
A basic RESTful API built using node-'Express'. It can be used to perform basic CRUD operations using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. It also demonstrates how we can use 'express-handlebars' as a templating engine to render html layouts from the back-end.

An example of this is shown below, where a 'members' list is updated using data from a form that is rendered on the server using layouts/express-handlebars:

This example was done with the help of online documentation for Express and the package express-handlebars, and the teachings of Brad Traversy.
